> This project is about EDA Analysis on Lending Club data for past few years , covering data about their credit loan taken and other financial background about each member of the club.
Exploratory Analysis would ensure we get understanding the past behavior , the patterns , the financial evaluation score and ratios to take better decision on the new loans being offered.

## Problem Statement and Analysis Approach
> To Analyze the Lending club data set with all the information on loan given last few years and understand how some variable impacts or not towards loan success to have a loan decision made for new loans . It is important to understand the parameters which should be considered in taking loan approval decision and if some actions can be taken to secure loan customer.
### Analysis approach
- Understand credit funding parameters and factors affecting same through public knowledge and apply same on data set.
- Use EDA principles to analyse the data set 
- Clean , remove, rename and derive parameters ( columns )
- Use Data visualization methods to understand univariate and Bi variate patterns 
- Describe inferences for parameters impacting credit funding decision.


## Factors for Risk Analysis of Credit Lending
- 5 C of Credit â€“ Character , Capacity, Collateral , Capital , Conditions 
- Credit score factors : Payment history-35% , Amounts owned -30%  , Credit history length (15%) , Credit mix(10%), New credits opened (10%).
- Credit utilization ratio = total revolving credit being used/  total of all revolving credit limits. Using more than 30% of your available credit is not good.
- Credit mix : car loan  student loan , credit card, mortgage and other credit prods , diversified mix and handling helps credit score.
- The longer the credit history , the higher the credit score.
- Number of hard enquiries lenders make towards borrower. Too much requests made in short time
